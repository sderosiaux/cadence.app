### Build premium Apple-style marketing homepage

**Prompt Analysis:** The user provided an exceptionally detailed and well-structured prompt with specific requirements for building a premium marketing homepage. The prompt included exact copy, design specifications, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria. This is an excellent example of effective prompting because it:
- Specified exact tech stack (React + TypeScript, Tailwind, framer-motion)
- Provided all copy and brand constants
- Defined clear visual direction (Apple-style, color palette, typography)
- Listed complete section architecture in order
- Set clear acceptance criteria (single file, responsive, accessible, performance targets)

- Premium animations with framer-motion
- Accessible with WCAG AA+ compliance
- Form validation and API-ready structure
- Inline SVGs and optimized performance
